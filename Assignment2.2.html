            JavaScript allows them to make the page dynamic. HTML allows for making text bold, creating text boxes, and creating buttons, 
            whereas JavaScript allows for changing text on the page, creating pop-up messages, 
            and validating text in text boxes to make sure required fields have been filled. 
            JavaScript makes web pages more dynamic by allowing users to interact with web pages, click on elements, and change the pages.
